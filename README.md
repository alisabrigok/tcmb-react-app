## Description

A beautiful React application that lets you display exchange rates that's officially (seriously tho, they are real data) announced by Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (a.k.a CBRT or TCMB) at any given date with filtering options.

Using this application you can:

- Display any given date's exchange rates (min year you can choose is 1996) that's officially announced by the CBRT.
- You can filter the results by currency (Dollar, Euro etc.)
- You can filter the results by data options (forex buying value, banknote selling value etc.)

The data is fetched from CBRT's API using [tcmb-exchange-rates npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tcmb-exchange-rates 'tcmb-exchange-rates'), a package that I personally developed that makes fetching and using the exchange rates a lot easier.
